@a sets out to find the @t. 
Somewhere beneath the planet's surface, the @t is said to be hidden. 
  Text for different types of planets:
@p@a enters the orbit of the third planet from the star in the @s star system. The red glow from the @s star lights up the whole command room. On the planet, a barren desert landscape can be seen. @m@a's sensors show high measurements of dangerous activity under the planet's surface, but also high measurements of gold and other valuables!
@pBarely escaping an intense asteroid belt, @a approaches @s IV, a blue planet filled with water and life in the @s star system. @mThe flora and fauna seems to be sprawling on the planet's surface, but there also seem to be huge caverns filled with treasures underneath!
@pAt the speed of light, @a enters the star system of the white dwarf @s. A planet draws closer; @s III, a cold, cold planet filled with not much more than ice. @m While the planet seems to once have been filled with sprawling life, not much is left. The few creatures that are still there have adapted to a life beneath the surface. Yet, you should be careful, because creatures that can survive in such a deadly environment are sure to be dangerous!

@p@a’s ship orbits around @s II, a rocky planet filled with volcanoes and lava. @m @a’s sensors show signs of extreme temperatures – is it a good idea to land here at all? Hopefully, the treasures below will be worth the danger!

@p@a enters the legendary @s star system, whose largest planet once was the home of one of the largest metropolises in history. The planet’s whole surface is densely filled with roads and buildings, but there’s not much life left. What is left, although, are monsters, old service androids and rogue treasure hunters roaming the vast underground tunnels. @m

@pOnly one planet is to be found in the system of the small @s star; a lone desert planet. It’s quiet; a little too quiet! There’s not much atmosphere to talk of and nothing much seems to be found on the planet’s surface, but what is hidden underneath? @m

@pLarge amounts of junk orbits the star and the planets in the @s star system. @a heads for the planet @s VI, a planet that was once one of the largest active space dumps in the galaxy, but was abandoned since it was filled to its capacity. Now, its inhabitants are mostly old service androids and low-intelligence creatures adapted to the hazardous environment. @m

@p@a enters the @s star system, a system filled with many large gas giants. Among those gas giants, there’s a planet with a solid surface: @s IV. @a’s sensors speak of a very dangerous climate on @s IV; there are storms, volcano eruptions and strong seismic activities. @m Any creatures living in the caverns beneath this surface are sure to be tough!

@pWhile @a’s ship comes closer to the planet @s II, the control room lights up from the bright light that reflects of the planet’s surface. [Scene] II is a crystal planet, with a surface full of large rare-metal crystals, reflecting beautiful colors. @m Such a planet is sure to be filled with treasure!

@p@a’s ship orbits around the third planet in the @s star system; a planet with large rivers of toxic waste and an atmosphere filled with hazardous gases. @m The creatures that have adapted to this environment are guaranteed to be dangerous, and the rogues that are willing to land here, likewise!
